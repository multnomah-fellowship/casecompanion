      = app_dropdown 'How might this date change?' do
        %p
          Earliest Release Date is not firm until closer to release. It gets
          updated periodically by counselors. The closer to release, the more
          predictable this date becomes.

        %p.mdl-typography--body-2
          What does Earliest Release Date include?
        %p
          Earliest Release Date includes the sentence minus 20% Earned Time.

        %p.mdl-typography--body-2
          What is Earned Time?
        %p
          Earned Time is 20% credited at the beginning of the sentence. Earned
          time can be lost due to infractions and counselors update earned time
          periodically.

        %p.mdl-typography--body-2
          What are some other programs that may move the date earlier than that?
        %p
          Short Term Transitional Leave can subtract up to 90 days in addition to
          earned time for certain offenders. To learn more visit the #{link_to 'DOC FAQs', "http://www.oregon.gov/doc/OMR/Pages/religious_services/victims_services/victim_issues.aspx#Crime_Victims'_FAQ's"}.

        %p.mdl-typography--body-2
          Are there other programs that may allow the offender to spend time in
          the community?
        %p
          There are Alternative Incarceration Programs available in three
          institutions in Oregon that allow a small number of offenders to undergo
          treatment in the community. If they graduate these programs successfully
          they will be released earlier in addition to earned time.  To learn more
          check out #{link_to 'this summary by Crime Victims United', 'http://www.crimevictimsunited.org/issues/corrections/aip.htm'}.
