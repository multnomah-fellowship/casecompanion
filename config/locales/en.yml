      We couldn't find that offender. You may want to double-check the SID you
      used to search.

      We currently only have information on offenders in the prison system–if
      the offender with SID %{search_sid} is not currently in a state prison
      then we will not have their information.

    error_no_results_by_name: |
      We couldn't find that offender. You may want to double-check the spelling
      of the names you used to search.

      We currently only have information on offenders in the prison system–if
      the offender you searched for (%{first_name} %{last_name}) is not
      currently in a state prison then we will not have their information.

    error_too_many_results: |
      Your search returned too many results. You may want to check that you are
      searching with both the first name and the last name.
