        The time between arrest and prosecution can be hectic. Here’s what to expect and where to get support:

        <strong>Within 48 - 72 hrs of reporting a crime</strong>
        Prosecutors will review evidence and make a charging decision.

        <strong>Within 3 days of reporting the crime</strong>
        You’ll receive a call from an advocate about a scheduled arraignment. An arraignment is a hearing for the District Attorney to officially press charges. As a victim, you have the right to attend but can choose not to.

        <strong>Within 7 days of reporting the crime</strong>
        In felony cases, a Grand Jury will be scheduled. You may receive a subpoena to testify as a witness, which shows the date, time, and location in our office where they are expected to appear and testify.

        The offender will not be present at the grand jury. It will be you along with the prosecutor and any other witnesses in the case.

        <strong>Within about 30 days of reporting the crime</strong>
        Trial is scheduled. You may be subpoenaed to testify as a witness through mail.

        - title: What happens after conviction?
          body: |
            The judge sets the sentence and conditions at the time of conviction. Depending on the length and conditions, the offender either stays in a county jail (if the sentence is less than 1 year) or is transferred to prison (if sentence is longer than 1 year)

            <strong>Prison</strong>
            After sentencing the offender will go through intake at Coffee Creek Correctional Facility. The intake process takes about three to four weeks at which point, male offenders will be transferred to a long-term facility.

            <a href="http://docpub.state.or.us/OOS/intro.jsf">Look up offender status</a> to see the projected earliest release date.

        - title: How might the earliest release date change?
          body: |
            Earliest Release Date is not firm until closer to release. It gets updated periodically by counselors. The closer to release, the more predictable this date becomes.

            What does Earliest Release Date include?
            Earliest Release Date includes the sentence minus 20% Earned Time.

            What is Earned Time?
            Earned Time is 20% credited at the beginning of the sentence. Earned time can be lost due to infractions and counselors update earned time periodically.

            What are some other programs that may move the date earlier than that?
            Short Term Transitional Leave can subtract up to 90 days in addition to earned time for certain offenders. To learn more visit the <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/doc/OPS/PRISON/pages/prisons_faq.aspx#Why_do_inmates_get_out_of_prison_early_">DOC FAQs</a>.

            Are there other programs that may allow the offender to spend time in the community?
            There are Alternative Incarceration Programs available in three institutions in Oregon that allow a small number of offenders to undergo treatment in the community. If they graduate these programs successfully they will be released earlier in addition to earned time.

          body: |
            Was the crime committed before 1989? Parole is only applicable if the offender was sentenced to prison prior to 1989.

            If yes, you have the right to attend and/or speak at the parole hearing.

            Register with the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision for parole hearing notifications.  Victim specialist, Robyn Masella will get in touch with you and help you prepare and navigate the parole hearings process.

        You may hear many confusing technical and legal terms that describe an offender’s supervision.

        Although there are differences, all types of community supervision have two things in common.  First, each offender has conditions he or she must follow.  Second, the offender is supervised by a parole/probation officer all of whom work for our Department.

      dropdowns:
        - title: What are the different types of supervision?
          body: |
            <strong>Post-Prison Supervision*</strong> is the current legal term for supervision after prison and <strong>Probation</strong> is the term for supervision instead of prison.

            *Prior to 1989, Post-Prison Supervision was called Parole.  Parole is still used today if the offender was sentenced to prison prior to 1989. It is the same as Post-Prison Supervision in that the offender has to follow conditions of supervision set by the Oregon Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision.
        - title: How do I learn about the the terms of my offender’s supervision?
          body: |
            To learn the specific conditions of supervision for an offender, please contact his or her probation/parole officer.

          body: |
            State and federal law limits the information we can give you about an offender. We can tell you:

            <ul>
              <li>Why the person is under supervision</li>
              <li>Physical description and age</li>

          body: |
            For victims under 18 at the time of the crime, they have the right to request special post-prison conditions.
        - title: How can I be notified about changes or violations of supervision?
          body: |
            You have the right to be notified about probation/parole violation hearings and changes to supervision.

          body: |
            First, call 9-1-1 if you are in danger or to report a new crime.

            For less urgent concerns, you can call the offender's PO. The PO will investigate to determine if there has been a violation.

            If being harassed by a youth offender or the youth’s family, contact the police to file a report, report the incident to juvenile’s assigned court counselor or notify the Victim’s Advocate in the District Attorney’s Office at Juvenile Court.
        - title: How do I get a restraining order?
          body: |
            A restraining order is a court order which requires someone else to stop an undesirable behavior such as contacting you, being near you, or living with you.

            Depending on who you are looking to file the restraining order against (the “respondent”), there are different qualifications, and the respondent will have a chance to contest the restraining order in front of a judge.

            A restraining order can be obtained in one day, if you begin in the morning. The process usually takes several hours.

            The best way to get a restraining order in Portland for intimate partner violence is to go to the <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/gatewaycenter/article/307964">Gateway Center</a> at:

            10305 East Burnside Street
            Portland, OR 97216

            Pick up a free set of blank Restraining Order forms at the:
            Family Law Clerk
            Multnomah County Courthouse
            1021 SW 4th Avenue, Room 211
            Portland

            Bring identification with you.

            The Office is open from 8am to 5pm. The Family Law Clerk is available between 11am and 12:45pm to help you fill out the application and answer any questions.  If you turn in your completed forms before 12:45pm, you will go before the judge at 1:30pm the same day.

            After the judge grants the order, the Court Clerk will work with you to determine how it will be served on the respondent.  If the respondent opposes the order, he or she must notify the court to set a hearing date.  Please keep the court informed of your address so you can be notified of a hearing.

            <strong>Restraining Order Violations</strong>
            If the respondent does not obey the Restraining Order, call 911 or the police non-emergency number.  Tell police you have a Restraining Order and need their help enforcing it.

            <strong>If you want to drop the Restraining Order</strong>
            If you decide you want to drop the Restraining Order, go to the Family Law Clerk’s office and fill out a form asking the Judge to vacate (remove) the Restraining Order.  If the Judge signs the Order, give copies to the Family Law Clerk and the Sheriff’s office.  The Restraining Order will remain in effect until the order to vacate is signed.
