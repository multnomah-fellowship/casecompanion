      then we will not have their information.

        The time between arrest and prosecution can be hectic. Here’s what to expect and where to get support:

        Within 48 - 72 hrs of reporting a crime
        Prosecutors will review evidence and make a charging decision.

        Within 3 days of reporting the crime
        You’ll receive a call from an advocate about a scheduled arraignment. An arraignment is a hearing for the District Attorney to officially press charges. As a victim, you have the right to attend but can choose not to.

        Within 7 days of reporting the crime
        In felony cases, a Grand Jury will be scheduled. You may receive a subpoena to testify as a witness, which shows the date, time, and location in our office where they are expected to appear and testify.

        Within about 30 days of reporting the crime
        Trial is scheduled. You may be subpoenaed to testify as a witness through mail.

        You may hear many confusing technical and legal terms that describe an offender’s supervision.

        Although there are differences, all types of community supervision have two things in common.  First, each offender has conditions he or she must follow.  Second, the offender is supervised by a parole/probation officer all of whom work for our Department.

      - title: What are the different types of supervision?
        body: |
          <strong>Post-Prison Supervision*</strong> is the current legal term for supervision after prison and <strong>Probation</strong> is the term for supervision instead of prison.

          *Prior to 1989, Post-Prison Supervision was called Parole.  Parole is still used today if the offender was sentenced to prison prior to 1989. It is the same as Post-Prison Supervision in that the offender has to follow conditions of supervision set by the Oregon Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision.
